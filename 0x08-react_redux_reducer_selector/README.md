At the end of this project, I should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within my application
Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible
Why mutations should not happen within a reducer
The use of Immutable within the reducer
The use of Normalizr within the app
Selectors: what they are and when to use them
